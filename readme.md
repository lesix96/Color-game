# The Color Game

The purpose of a game is guess the color by rgb-code. The game has 2 levels: easy (with three options of color) and hard (with three options of color). If the color is guessed correctly, the header lights up in correct color, if not - the field with the incorrectly selected color disappears and you need to select the correct option from the remaining fields.
The code is written by functional programming.
